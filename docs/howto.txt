------------------------------
bullet contact callback problem (used in track movement, as a conveyor belt mechanism)
*contact motion seems to have the maxmum speed of 10, no matter how large the value you gave to the variable
<current solution>
set speed at forward direction
**new problem**
cannot use body rotation as forward direction
**solution**
enable friction 2 and calculate the forward direction use closest contact point's normal and frictionDir2 (which is vertical to normal but towords the left side)
